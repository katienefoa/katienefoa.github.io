# Hi! I'm Katienefoa Soro
I started my career as an IT support technician. I quickly became proficient in the software programs
I was using and began teaching others. Over the years, I grew curious about how software is created and why some products are difficult to use while others feel intuitive.
This led me to my second career in data engineering and backend development. I taught myself
Snowflake, AWS cloud and ETL processes and soon began data engineer and building my own ETL 
applications.

I am passionate about building robust, data-driven solutions that transform raw data into meaningful insights. 
I am a lifelong learner who enjoys teaching and sharing knowledge,which has shaped my work in data science and data engineering and my commitment to creating scalable, impactful data products.

I am currently seeking opportunities that leverage my expertise in data science and data engineering, where I can apply my industry knowledge while continuing to grow as a technical leader and strategist. 
I welcome the chance to collaborate on data-driven teams and contribute to building scalable, high-impact solutions.
